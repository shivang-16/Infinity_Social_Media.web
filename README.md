# Infinity - A Social Media Platform for Developers

Built on the MERN stack - combining MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js - Infinity is dynamic, and secure platform for connecting and sharing with your network. 

## Overview

**How I built it:**

1️⃣ **Redux for State Management:** I've used the Redux library to handle the application's state effectively. It keeps our app organized and responsive.

2️⃣ **Nodemailer for OTPs:** I've integrated Nodemailer into the app to send emails through Node.js. This ensures secure delivery of one-time passwords (OTPs).

3️⃣ **Cloudinary Integration:** We've connected our app with Cloudinary to generate links for the photos and videos you upload, making them easily accessible.

4️⃣ **MongoDB as the Backbone:** MongoDB serves as the backbone of our app, storing and organizing all the data, ensuring it's readily available when needed.

5️⃣ **Bcrypt for Password Hashing:** To enhance security, I've employed Bcrypt to hash and protect passwords, adding an extra layer of safeguard for user accounts.
